/*
Problem Statement : 
Problem 112
===========
   Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its
   left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.
   Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a
   decreasing number; for example, 66420.
   We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing
   a "bouncy" number; for example, 155349.
   Clearly there cannot be any bouncy numbers below one-hundred, but just
   over half of the numbers below one-thousand (525) are bouncy. In fact, the
   least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers first reaches 50%
   is 538.
   Surprisingly, bouncy numbers become more and more common and by the time
   we reach 21780 the proportion of bouncy numbers is equal to 90%.
   Find the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers is
   exactly 99%.
