Problem Statement : 
Problem 374
===========
   An integer partition of a number n is a way of writing n as a sum of
   positive integers.
   Partitions that differ only in the order of their summands are considered
   the same.A partition of n into distinct parts is a partition of n in which
   every part occurs at most once.
   The partitions of 5 into distinct parts are:
   5, 4+1 and 3+2.
   Let f(n) be the maximum product of the parts of any such partition of n
   into distinct parts and let m(n) be the number of elements of any such
   partition of n with that product.
   So f(5)=6 and m(5)=2.
   For n=10 the partition with the largest product is 10=2+3+5, which gives
   f(10)=30 and m(10)=3.
   And their product, f(10)·m(10) = 30·3 = 90
   It can be verified that
   ∑f(n)·m(n) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 = 1683550844462.
   Find ∑f(n)·m(n) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^14.
   Give your answer modulo 982451653, the 50 millionth prime.
