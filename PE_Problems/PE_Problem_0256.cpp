Problem Statement : 
Problem 256
===========
   Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a room,
   without overlap.
   Assuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions 1×2, there
   are obviously some limitations for the shape and size of the rooms that
   can be covered.
   For this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer
   dimensions a, b and even size s = a·b.
   We use the term 'size' to denote the floor surface area of the room, and —
   without loss of generality — we add the condition a ≤ b.
   There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no
   points where corners of four different mats meet.
   For example, consider the two arrangements below for a 4×4 room:
   The arrangement on the left is acceptable, whereas the one on the right is
   not: a red "X" in the middle, marks the point where four tatami meet.
   Because of this rule, certain even-sized rooms cannot be covered with
   tatami: we call them tatami-free rooms.
   Further, we define T(s) as the number of tatami-free rooms of size s.
   The smallest tatami-free room has size s = 70 and dimensions 7×10.
   All the other rooms of size s = 70 can be covered with tatami; they are:
   1×70, 2×35 and 5×14.
   Hence, T(70) = 1.
   Similarly, we can verify that T(1320) = 5 because there are exactly 5
   tatami-free rooms of size s = 1320:
   20×66, 22×60, 24×55, 30×44 and 33×40.
   In fact, s = 1320 is the smallest room-size s for which T(s) = 5.
   Find the smallest room-size s for which T(s) = 200.
