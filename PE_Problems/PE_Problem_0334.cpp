Problem Statement : 
Problem 334
===========
   In Plato's heaven, there exist an infinite number of bowls in a straight
   line.
   Each bowl either contains some or none of a finite number of beans.
   A child plays a game, which allows only one kind of move: removing two
   beans from any bowl, and putting one in each of the two adjacent bowls.
   The game ends when each bowl contains either one or no beans.
   For example, consider two adjacent bowls containing 2 and 3 beans
   respectively, all other bowls being empty. The following eight moves will
   finish the game:
   You are given the following sequences:
   t[0] = 123456.
            t[i-1] ,         if t[i-1] is even
   t[i] =   2
            t[i-1]   926252, if t[i-1] is odd
            2
           where ⌊x⌋ is the floor function
           and is the bitwise XOR operator.
   b[i] = ( t[i] mod 2^11) + 1.
   The first two terms of the last sequence are b[1] = 289 and b[2] = 145.
   If we start with b[1] and b[2] beans in two adjacent bowls, 3419100 moves
   would be required to finish the game.
   Consider now 1500 adjacent bowls containing b[1], b[2],..., b[1500] beans
   respectively, all other bowls being empty. Find how many moves it takes
   before the game ends.
