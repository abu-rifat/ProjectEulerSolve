Problem Statement : 
Problem 90
==========
   Each of the six faces on a cube has a different digit (0 to 9) written on
   it; the same is done to a second cube. By placing the two cubes
   side-by-side in different positions we can form a variety of 2-digit
   numbers.
   For example, the square number 64 could be formed:
   In fact, by carefully choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible to
   display all of the square numbers below one-hundred: 01, 04, 09, 16, 25,
   36, 49, 64, and 81.
   For example, one way this can be achieved is by placing {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
   on one cube and {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} on the other cube.
   However, for this problem we shall allow the 6 or 9 to be turned
   upside-down so that an arrangement like {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and {1, 2, 3,
   4, 6, 7} allows for all nine square numbers to be displayed; otherwise it
   would be impossible to obtain 09.
   In determining a distinct arrangement we are interested in the digits on
   each cube, not the order.
   {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is equivalent to {3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5}
   {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is distinct from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
   But because we are allowing 6 and 9 to be reversed, the two distinct sets
   in the last example both represent the extended set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
   for the purpose of forming 2-digit numbers.
   How many distinct arrangements of the two cubes allow for all of the
   square numbers to be displayed?
