Problem Statement : 
Problem 128
===========
   A hexagonal tile with number 1 is surrounded by a ring of six hexagonal
   tiles, starting at "12 o'clock" and numbering the tiles 2 to 7 in an
   anti-clockwise direction.
   New rings are added in the same fashion, with the next rings being
   numbered 8 to 19, 20 to 37, 38 to 61, and so on. The diagram below shows
   the first three rings.
   By finding the difference between tile n and each its six neighbours we
   shall define PD(n) to be the number of those differences which are prime.
   For example, working clockwise around tile 8 the differences are 12, 29,
   11, 6, 1, and 13. So PD(8) = 3.
   In the same way, the differences around tile 17 are 1, 17, 16, 1, 11, and
   10, hence PD(17) = 2.
   It can be shown that the maximum value of PD(n) is 3.
   If all of the tiles for which PD(n) = 3 are listed in ascending order to
   form a sequence, the 10th tile would be 271.
   Find the 2000th tile in this sequence.
