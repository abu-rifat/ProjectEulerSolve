Problem Statement : 
Problem 267
===========
   You are given a unique investment opportunity.
   Starting with £1 of capital, you can choose a fixed proportion, f, of your
   capital to bet on a fair coin toss repeatedly for 1000 tosses.
   Your return is double your bet for heads and you lose your bet for tails.
   For example, if f = 1/4, for the first toss you bet £0.25, and if heads
   comes up you win £0.5 and so then have £1.5. You then bet £0.375 and if
   the second toss is tails, you have £1.125.
   Choosing f to maximize your chances of having at least £1,000,000,000
   after 1,000 flips, what is the chance that you become a billionaire?
   All computations are assumed to be exact (no rounding), but give your
   answer rounded to 12 digits behind the decimal point in the form
   0.abcdefghijkl.
