Problem Statement : 
Problem 125
===========
   The palindromic number 595 is interesting because it can be written as the
   sum of consecutive squares: 6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 + 11^2 + 12^2.
   There are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be
   written as consecutive square sums, and the sum of these palindromes is
   4164. Note that 1 = 0^2 + 1^2 has not been included as this problem is
   concerned with the squares of positive integers.
   Find the sum of all the numbers less than 10^8 that are both palindromic
   and can be written as the sum of consecutive squares.
