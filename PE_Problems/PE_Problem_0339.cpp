Problem Statement : 
Problem 339
===========
   "And he came towards a valley, through which ran a river; and the borders
   of the valley were wooded, and on each side of the river were level
   meadows. And on one side of the river he saw a flock of white sheep, and
   on the other a flock of black sheep. And whenever one of the white sheep
   bleated, one of the black sheep would cross over and become white; and
   when one of the black sheep bleated, one of the white sheep would cross
   over and become black."

   Initially each flock consists of n sheep. Each sheep (regardless of
   colour) is equally likely to be the next sheep to bleat. After a sheep has
   bleated and a sheep from the other flock has crossed over, Peredur may
   remove a number of white sheep in order to maximize the expected final
   number of black sheep. Let E(n) be the expected final number of black
   sheep if Peredur uses an optimal strategy.
   You are given that E(5) = 6.871346 rounded to 6 places behind the decimal
   point.
   Find E(10 000) and give your answer rounded to 6 places behind the decimal
   point.
