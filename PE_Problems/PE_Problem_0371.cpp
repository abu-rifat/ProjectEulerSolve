Problem Statement : 
Problem 371
===========
   Oregon licence plates consist of three letters followed by a three digit
   number (each digit can be from [0..9]).
   While driving to work Seth plays the following game:
   Whenever the numbers of two licence plates seen on his trip add to 1000
   that's a win.
   E.g. MIC-012 and HAN-988 is a win and RYU-500 and SET-500 too. (as long as
   he sees them in the same trip).
   Find the expected number of plates he needs to see for a win.
   Give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.
   Note: We assume that each licence plate seen is equally likely to have any
   three digit number on it.
