Problem Statement : 
Problem 163
===========
   Consider an equilateral triangle in which straight lines are drawn from
   each vertex to the middle of the opposite side, such as in the size 1
   triangle in the sketch below.
   Sixteen triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or
   location can now be observed in that triangle. Using size 1 triangles as
   building blocks, larger triangles can be formed, such as the size 2
   triangle in the above sketch. One-hundred and four triangles of either
   different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed in
   that size 2 triangle.
   It can be observed that the size 2 triangle contains 4 size 1 triangle
   building blocks. A size 3 triangle would contain 9 size 1 triangle
   building blocks and a size n triangle would thus contain n^2 size 1
   triangle building blocks.
   If we denote T(n) as the number of triangles present in a triangle of size
   n, then
   T(1) = 16
   T(2) = 104
   Find T(36).
