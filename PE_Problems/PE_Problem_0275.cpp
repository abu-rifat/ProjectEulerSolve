Problem Statement : 
Problem 275
===========
   Let us define a balanced sculpture of order n as follows:
     • A polyomino made up of n+1 tiles known as the blocks (n tiles)
       and the plinth (remaining tile);
     • the plinth has its centre at position (x = 0, y = 0);
     • the blocks have y-coordinates greater than zero (so the plinth is the
       unique lowest tile);
     • the centre of mass of all the blocks, combined, has x-coordinate equal
       to zero.
   When counting the sculptures, any arrangements which are simply
   reflections about the y-axis, are not counted as distinct. For example,
   the 18 balanced sculptures of order 6 are shown below; note that each pair
   of mirror images (about the y-axis) is counted as one sculpture:
   There are 964 balanced sculptures of order 10 and 360505 of order 15.
   How many balanced sculptures are there of order 18?
