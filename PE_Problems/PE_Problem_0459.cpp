Problem Statement : 
Problem 459
===========
   The flipping game is a two player game played on a N by N square board.
   Each square contains a disk with one side white and one side black.
   The game starts with all disks showing their white side.
   A turn consists of flipping all disks in a rectangle with the following
   properties:
     • the upper right corner of the rectangle contains a white disk
     • the rectangle width is a perfect square (1, 4, 9, 16, ...)
     • the rectangle height is a triangular number (1, 3, 6, 10, ...)
   Players alternate turns. A player wins by turning the grid all black.
   Let W(N) be the number of winning moves for the first player on a N by N
   board with all disks white, assuming perfect play.
   W(1) = 1, W(2) = 0, W(5) = 8 and W(10^2) = 31395.
   For N=5, the first player's eight winning first moves are:
   Find W(10^6).
