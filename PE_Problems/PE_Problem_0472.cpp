Problem Statement : 
Problem 472
===========
   There are N seats in a row. N people come one after another to fill the
   seats according to the following rules:
    1. No person sits beside another.
    2. The first person chooses any seat.
    3. Each subsequent person chooses the seat furthest from anyone else
       already seated, as long as it does not violate rule 1. If there is
       more than one choice satisfying this condition, then the person
       chooses the leftmost choice.
   Note that due to rule 1, some seats will surely be left unoccupied, and
   the maximum number of people that can be seated is less than N (for N >
   1).
   Here are the possible seating arrangements for N = 15:
   We see that if the first person chooses correctly, the 15 seats can seat
   up to 7 people.
   We can also see that the first person has 9 choices to maximize the number
   of people that may be seated.
   Let f(N) be the number of choices the first person has to maximize the
   number of occupants for N seats in a row. Thus, f(1) = 1, f(15) = 9,
   f(20) = 6, and f(500) = 16.
   Also, ∑f(N) = 83 for 1 ≤ N ≤ 20 and ∑f(N) = 13343 for 1 ≤ N ≤ 500.
   Find ∑f(N) for 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^12. Give the last 8 digits of your answer.
