Problem Statement : 
Problem 394
===========
   Jeff eats a pie in an unusual way.
   The pie is circular. He starts with slicing an initial cut in the pie
   along a radius.
   While there is at least a given fraction F of pie left, he performs the
   following procedure:
   - He makes two slices from the pie centre to any point of what is
   remaining of the pie border, any point on the remaining pie border equally
   likely. This will divide the remaining pie into three pieces.
   - Going counterclockwise from the initial cut, he takes the first two pie
   pieces and eats them.
   When less than a fraction F of pie remains, he does not repeat this
   procedure. Instead, he eats all of the remaining pie.
   For x ≥ 1, let E(x) be the expected number of times Jeff repeats the
   procedure above with F = ^1/[x].
   It can be verified that E(1) = 1, E(2) ≈ 1.2676536759, and E(7.5) ≈
   2.1215732071.
   Find E(40) rounded to 10 decimal places behind the decimal point.
