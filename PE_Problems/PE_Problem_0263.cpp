Problem Statement : 
Problem 263
===========
   Consider the number 6. The divisors of 6 are: 1,2,3 and 6.
   Every number from 1 up to and including 6 can be written as a sum of
   distinct divisors of 6:
   1=1, 2=2, 3=1+2, 4=1+3, 5=2+3, 6=6.
   A number n is called a practical number if every number from 1 up to and
   including n can be expressed as a sum of distinct divisors of n.
   A pair of consecutive prime numbers with a difference of six is called a
   sexy pair (since "sex" is the Latin word for "six"). The first sexy pair
   is (23, 29).
   We may occasionally find a triple-pair, which means three consecutive sexy
   prime pairs, such that the second member of each pair is the first member
   of the next pair.
   We shall call a number n such that :
     • (n-9, n-3), (n-3,n+3), (n+3, n+9) form a triple-pair, and
     • the numbers n-8, n-4, n, n+4 and n+8 are all practical,
   an engineers’ paradise.
   Find the sum of the first four engineers’ paradises.
