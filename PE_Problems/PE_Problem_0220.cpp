Problem Statement : 
Problem 220
===========
   Let D[0] be the two-letter string "Fa". For n≥1, derive D[n] from D[n-1]
   by the string-rewriting rules:
   "a" → "aRbFR"
   "b" → "LFaLb"
   Thus, D[0] = "Fa", D[1] = "FaRbFR", D[2] = "FaRbFRRLFaLbFR", and so on.
   These strings can be interpreted as instructions to a computer graphics
   program, with "F" meaning "draw forward one unit", "L" meaning "turn left
   90 degrees", "R" meaning "turn right 90 degrees", and "a" and "b" being
   ignored. The initial position of the computer cursor is (0,0), pointing up
   towards (0,1).
   Then D[n] is an exotic drawing known as the Heighway Dragon of order n.
   For example, D[10] is shown below; counting each "F" as one step, the
   highlighted spot at (18,16) is the position reached after 500 steps.
   What is the position of the cursor after 10^12 steps in D[50] ?
   Give your answer in the form x,y with no spaces.
