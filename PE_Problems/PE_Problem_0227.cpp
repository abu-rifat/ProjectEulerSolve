Problem Statement : 
Problem 227
===========
   "The Chase" is a game played with two dice and an even number of players.
   The players sit around a table; the game begins with two opposite players
   having one die each. On each turn, the two players with a die roll it.
   If a player rolls a 1, he passes the die to his neighbour on the left; if
   he rolls a 6, he passes the die to his neighbour on the right; otherwise,
   he keeps the die for the next turn.
   The game ends when one player has both dice after they have been rolled
   and passed; that player has then lost.
   In a game with 100 players, what is the expected number of turns the game
   lasts?
   Give your answer rounded to ten significant digits.
