Problem Statement : 
Problem 86
==========
   A spider, S, sits in one corner of a cuboid room, measuring 6 by 5 by 3,
   and a fly, F, sits in the opposite corner. By travelling on the surfaces
   of the room the shortest "straight line" distance from S to F is 10 and
   the path is shown on the diagram.
   However, there are up to three "shortest" path candidates for any given
   cuboid and the shortest route doesn't always have integer length.
   By considering all cuboid rooms with integer dimensions, up to a maximum
   size of M by M by M, there are exactly 2060 cuboids for which the shortest
   route has integer length when M=100, and this is the least value of M for
   which the number of solutions first exceeds two thousand; the number of
   solutions is 1975 when M=99.
   Find the least value of M such that the number of solutions first exceeds
   one million.
